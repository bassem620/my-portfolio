              As a junior at Helwan University's Faculty of Computer Science and
              Artificial Intelligence, I am on track to graduate in 2025. <br />
              <br /> My expertise lies in full-stack development, with a strong
              focus on utilizing the MERN stack to build dynamic and responsive
              applications. <br />I possess a comprehensive background in both
              frontend and backend development, which allows me to contribute to
              all aspects of the software development lifecycle. <br />
              <br />I am always eager to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date
              with the latest technologies in order to broaden my skill set.
